# Pico Reporter

This is a tool for getting custom reports out of Planning Center Online (pco hence the pico). Someday the idea would be that you can download a custom report configuration and run it against your database. Much like the built-in custom reporting module but easier to use.

## To-do
1. Harden the authentication module
+ Caching
+ Implement OAuth
+ Build out PHP API wrapper
